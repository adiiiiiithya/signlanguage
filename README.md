Hello! This repository contains the environment setup for the Sign Language Interpreter project. The environment is managed using *Anaconda* to ensure all dependencies are properly installed.
I've created a sign language interpreter that implements OpenCV and MediaPipe(Landmark detection) to recognize hand gestures. 
Either download the enviroment.yml file and activate it, or download requirements.txt and run pip install "-r requirements.txt"
 in cmd.
